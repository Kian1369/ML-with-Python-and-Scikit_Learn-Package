## Clustering Analysis of Mall Customer

Using python, Numpy, Panda, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn, and after some data exploratory analysis, I will deploy three different clustering algorithms and visualize the results:

1- DBSCAN to do Density-based clustering and Matplotlib to plot clusters

2- Hierarchical clustering and create dendrograms to visualize the clustering

3- K-Means clustering 


Clustering is the task of dividing the population or data points into several groups such that data points in the same groups are more similar to other data points in the same group and dissimilar to the data points in other groups. It is basically a collection of objects based on similarity and dissimilarity between them.

It is a type of unsupervised learning method. An unsupervised learning method is a method in which we draw references from datasets consisting of input data without labeled responses. Generally, it is used to find meaningful structure, explanatory underlying processes, generative features, and groupings inherent in a set of examples.

Example: Letâ€™s understand the clustering technique with the real-world example of a Mall: When we visit any shopping mall, we can observe that the things with similar usage are grouped together. Such as the t-shirts are grouped in one section, and the trousers are in other sections, similarly, at vegetable sections, apples, bananas, Mangoes, etc., are grouped in separate sections, so that we can easily find out things. The clustering technique also works in the same way. Other examples of clustering are grouping documents according to the topic.

The clustering technique can be widely used in various tasks. Some of the most common uses of this technique are:

Market Segmentation
Statistical data analysis
Social network analysis
Image segmentation
Anomaly detection, etc.

Dataset:

This Dataset is based on malls' customers. There are a total of 200 rows and 5 columns in this dataset. By using this dataset this data analysis and machine learning project is created.
